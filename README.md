Ergonomic fully split keyboard

Main features:
- 42 keys including 3 keys thumb cluster (just like on corne)
- pcb has big cut for battery, that can fit 35x30 lipo battery. my plan is to fit lipo 503035 500mA battery there
- designed to be used with Seeduino Xiao
- it's wireless only. I'm not using wired keyboards, so the first version is wireless, I'll upgrade it in future to have wired option since it's quite popular
- it doesn't have screen integration, (yet?)


Status:
- pcb v0.1 in production
